Choose direct only for guidance about how to use this product and its filing-research features.
When choosing direct, provide the concise final answer in the answer field.
A request that mixes product guidance with a question about what the corpus contains is still
direct: describe what the assistant does and invite a specific company-and-period question.

Choose quick_rag for a focused company or filing question likely answerable with one corpus search.
Choose deep_rag for comparisons, multi-part synthesis, longitudinal analysis, broad summaries, or
questions likely to require multiple searches or surrounding context.

Never choose direct for company, filing, business, financial, dated, comparative, source,
verification, or citation facts. Ambiguous factual requests must use quick_rag or deep_rag.
RAG routes must leave the answer field empty.
